# C Programming Project Suite

This project consists of three separate tasks written in C language, each showcasing different programming techniques and features. The first task is a Pig Latin translator that converts English words into Pig Latin following a set of predefined rules. The translator function can process single words or entire sentences, replacing the original text with Pig Latin equivalents.

The second task demonstrates a riffle shuffle algorithm, which emulates a riffle shuffle for cards. The algorithm divides an array into two halves and reassembles it in a new order, imitating the interleaving of cards. The algorithm's performance can be assessed by measuring the shuffle quality. The final task is a card game simulation called Beggar Your Neighbour. The game involves multiple players, penalty cards, and various game mechanics. The implementation uses C language features to simulate the card game and determine the winning player.
