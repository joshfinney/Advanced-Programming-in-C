Explanation:
    Based on the output of the average_quality function, 
    it seems that the quality of the shuffling algorithm improves as the number of shuffles increases, up to a certain point. 
    Specifically, for an array of size 50 and 30 trials, we can see that we need at least 7 shuffles to achieve an average quality close to 0.5. 
    This suggests that the algorithm becomes more effective at randomizing the elements of the array as more shuffles are performed, 
    up to a point where further shuffling doesn't yield much additional improvement in quality. 

    It's important to note that the quality values reported here are specific to the parameters used in the function, and may not be generalizable to other scenarios. 
    However, this information can be useful in guiding decisions about how many shuffles to use when randomizing an array of this size
